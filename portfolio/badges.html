  <h1>The Badges Problem</h1>
  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p class="introduction">Before I get into any details on how I discovered the pattern and came up with rules for my decision tree of the winners_losers.csv, I want to just say that you’re probably not going to like how I discovered my appropriate classifiers. Truth be told, I didn’t start working on this project until Wednesday in class. By listening to some of your “hints” about the possible classifiers, I learned that the last name didn’t matter at all, the first name’s length didn’t matter, and there was one attribute that would split the data almost perfectly. Given this information, I turned my attention to the first names and went with the first thought that popped into my head - the second letter of the first name defines a person winner or loser status.</p>

	<p class="introduction">Now that I had a hypothesis, I wanted to do some light testing. That is, I wanted to take a quick peek at the data and see how my hypothesis faired. From your hints I knew that if I found the correct attribute, it would be an almost perfect split. To my surprise, my first guess appeared correct. As I scrolled through the .csv file all but one of the names that I checked (which was quite a bit) adhered to my hypothesis, the name was “Dwight K. Schrute”. This name gave me a hint as to what the second attribute I would need to split on would be, but I’ll get to that later.</p>

	<p class="introduction">Doing a quick scan of the .csv to see if my hypothesis seemed to be working is all well and good, but I needed something more rigorous, more robust, more complete. Because of this, my unfamiliarity of WEKA, and time constraints I decided to solve my problem by writing a Perl script that would parse the .csv file and would split on attributes that I had selected. The script is included in my project6/ directory so you can take a look at it for yourself, but on a high level, all it does is read the .csv file, split each line on the comma character, put the two parts of a line into an array and then stuff that array into a larger array that held all of the lines from the file. From here, I wrote my function to split on a particular attribute. This function itself is not very long - it simply breaks the name part of a line into each letter, puts that into an array, and then uses the array to look at the second letter of the name and see if it’s a vowel (compare to constant string of vowels) and then push into one of two arrays for winners and losers. From here I added a quick averaging function to tell me what the percent split was among each of the resulting categories. The results are shown below.</p>

	<p class="introduction">The winner/loser split on vowels for vowels as second letter of first name...<br />
		Winner: 99.5260663507109%<br />
		Loser: 0.473933649289108%</p>

	<p class="introduction">The winner/loser split on consonants for vowel as second letter of first name...<br />
		Winner: 3.44827586206897%<br />
		Loser: 96.551724137931%</p>

	<p class="introduction">As you can see, this definitely matched the nearly perfect split that you mentioned in class. However, from what I observed when scrolling through the .csv file, I knew that there were names that were characters from The Office and I wondered if that was what was keeping this from being a perfect split. After some modifications that made the script print out the names of losers in the vowels-as-second-letters-of-first-name category and vice versa on those that were split on consonant. What resulted was that “Michael Scott” showed up in the winners category as a loser and “Andy Bernard”, “Creed Bratton”, and “Dwight K. Schrute” showed up under the losers class as winners. So, I added another function to my script that would look at a list of known Office characters and put them in the opposite winner/loser category of the one that they were currently listed. Once these changes were final, my results were as shown:</p>

	<p class="introduction">Vowels:<br />
	The winner/loser split on actors for characters from the office...<br />
		Winner: 0%<br />
		Loser: 100%</p>

	<p class="introduction">The winner/loser split on civilians for characters from the office...<br />
		Winner: 100%<br />
		Loser: 0%</p>

	<p class="introduction">Consonants:<br />
	The winner/loser split on actors for characters from the office...<br />
		Winner: 100%<br />
		Loser: 0%</p>

	<p class="introduction">The winner/loser split on civilians for characters from the office...<br />
		Winner: 0%<br />
		Loser: 100%</p>

	<p class="introduction">What this data is showing us is that after we look at the class of vowels after the initial split and we split based on their name matching a character from The Office, the new classifications are all 100% pure on all fronts. This signifies a successful decision tree for the winners_losers.csv data set. The tree itself looks something like on the following page.</p>
